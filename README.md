This is a Python-based application that uses computer vision to automatically scan Overwatch gameplay videos and extract information about player performance and hero usage. Technologies utilized:

* TensorFlow for image classification models
* PyTorch for object detection models
* OpenCV for image processing
* Pandas for various tasks

# NOTES
Repository does not include the trained models which are necessary to run due to size considerations. If you're interested in getting access to the pre-trained models or want to discuss how models were trained feel free to reach out. Models will be in continously retrained as I improve my dataset.
